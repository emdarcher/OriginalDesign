		    If things are not working, please copy and paste the OriginalDesign.pde file into a processing IDE, or sublime and run it locally, it should probably work that way. Then you should see a tiny 8x8 pixel bitmap displayed in the top left corner, with a letter "A". You can read the README.md file for a description of what the program is supposed to do.
